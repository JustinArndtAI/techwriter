   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Cannot include common words or your name

### Personalizing Your Profile

After successful login, you'll be prompted to complete your profile:

1. **Upload a professional headshot** (recommended - helps approvers identify requests)
2. **Verify your department** (Finance, IT, Marketing, Operations, etc.)
3. **Set your preferred currency** (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
4. **Choose notification preferences**:
   - Email notifications: Approval updates, budget alerts

   - SMS notifications: Emergency approvals only (optional)

**Important**: Your department selection determines your default approval workflow and spending limits. Contact your administrator if this looks incorrect.
